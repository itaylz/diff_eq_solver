A Python program to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using numerical methods like Euler's method.

## Features
- Supports user-defined first-order ODEs
- Euler's method implemented
- Visualizes solution using Matplotlib
- Command-line interface (CLI)

## Example
Solve: dy/dt = -9.8 with y(0) = 100

```bash
python main.py
